<div class="jumbotron jumboTitle">
  <h1>
    This is an entire application
  </h1>
  <p>
    When nicely coding
    <i>(not only 1 html and 1 controller)</i>
    that means
    <b>components way (angular2, react modern js dev)</b>,
    it requires much more time than just putting an html and a controller.
